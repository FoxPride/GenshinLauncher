## About

### Can this get me banned?
No it will not. This only uses [Unity command line arguments](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CommandLineArguments.html) that are built in itself. It essentially just runs the game with extra flags such as `-popupwindow`. [Here is miHoYo's response](https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/news/detail/5763) to using 3rd party tools.
